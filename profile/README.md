## Welcome to Melbourne Bitdevs

Melbourne BitDevs is an in-person meetup held monthly for discussing research and development of Bitcoin and related protocols. 

Melbourne Bitdevs is held on the last Thursday of every month at 6PM.

As a group, we discuss the latest Bitcoin news from a technical perspective. Sometimes diverging into adjacent fields of privacy, self hosting, free software, and more!

We'd love for you to join us, see [bitdevs.com.au/about](https://bitdevs.com.au/about).
